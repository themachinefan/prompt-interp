Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced plans to reduce its workforce by 11,000 employees, approximately 13% of its staff. Google's parent company Alphabet said it would lay off 12,000 workers. Microsoft is also cutting 10,000 jobs. The layoffs come after years of rapid hiring during the pandemic, when demand for digital services surged. Analysts say the tech industry over-hired during the boom years and is now correcting course as economic uncertainty grows. Many of the affected workers are in recruiting, corporate functions, and some engineering roles. The companies have offered severance packages and job placement assistance to affected employees.",

The deal, reached after intense negotiations that extended past the official deadline, creates a loss and damage fund that wealthy nations will contribute to. Developing countries have long demanded such a fund, arguing that rich nations bear the greatest responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement marks a significant shift in international climate policy. However, key details remain unresolved, including the total size of the fund and which countries will be required to contribute. Environmental groups praised the breakthrough while cautioning that implementation will be crucial.

      "article": "Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a new treatment approach for aggressive brain tumors that shows promising results in early clinical trials. The therapy combines immunotherapy with a novel drug delivery system that crosses the blood-brain barrier more effectively than existing treatments. In a trial involving 58 patients with glioblastoma, the most deadly form of brain cancer, 40% showed significant tumor reduction after three months of treatment. Standard treatments typically achieve response rates of around 10%. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Santos, cautioned that larger trials are needed before the treatment can be approved. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Nature Medicine. Glioblastoma affects approximately 12,000 Americans each year and has a median survival time of 15 months.",

The secret, I discovered, is using browned butter instead of regular melted butter. You want to heat the butter in a saucepan until it turns golden brown and smells nutty. Then let it cool completely before mixing. Another game-changer was chilling the dough for at least 24 hours. I know it's hard to wait, but trust me, the flavor development is worth it. I also switched from all-purpose flour to bread flour for chewier cookies. Use a mix of dark and milk chocolate chips for complexity. Bake at 375\u00b0F for exactly 10 minutes - they'll look underdone but will set as they cool. My family devoured three dozen in one sitting!",

      "article": "This paper examines the epistemological implications of modal realism as articulated by David Lewis, with particular attention to its consequences for our understanding of necessary truths. We argue that Lewis's concrete possible worlds ontology, while providing elegant solutions to problems in modal logic, generates insurmountable difficulties for any naturalized epistemology. The central problem concerns our epistemic access to other possible worlds: if these worlds are causally isolated from our own, as Lewis maintains, then our knowledge of modal facts becomes mysterious. We consider and reject several responses to this challenge, including the appeal to conceptual analysis and the claim that modal knowledge is a priori. We conclude by sketching an alternative moderate modal realism that preserves the advantages of Lewis's framework while avoiding its epistemological costs.",

After going down 1-0 early from a Saka screamer, Guardiola's men responded with three unanswered goals. Haaland was simply unstoppable, bullying the Arsenal defense and scoring twice. His first goal came from a perfectly weighted De Bruyne through ball, and his second was a towering header from a Grealish cross. Rodri sealed it with a long-range strike in the 78th minute that left Ramsdale rooted to the spot. Arsenal had their chances but Ederson made two crucial saves to keep them at bay. This result puts City five points clear at the top of the table with ten games remaining. The title race might just be over.",
